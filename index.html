            <h1>The Evolution of Web Design</h1>
            <p>
                In the early days of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, design was dictated by the limitations of HTML. 
                Web pages were primarily text-based, with blue hyperlinks and gray backgrounds. There was no CSS, 
                no layout engines, and certainly no mobile responsiveness.
            </p>

            <h2>The Era of Tables</h2>
            <p>
                As the web grew, designers started using <table> structures to create layouts. This allowed for 
                sidebars, headers, and grid-like designs. However, this code was messy and hard to maintain.
                It was a dark time for semantic markup, but it paved the way for future innovations.
            </p>

            <h2>The Rise of CSS</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) changed everything. It separated content from design. Suddenly, 
                colors, fonts, and layouts could be controlled from a single file. This is when the web 
                truly became beautiful. We saw the rise of the "Box Model" and float-based layouts.
            </p>

            <h2>Modern Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
                Today, we live in a mobile-first world. Flexbox and CSS Grid have revolutionized how we build 
                interfaces. Web design is no longer just about static pages; it's about dynamic, interactive 
                experiences that adapt to any screen size, from a smartwatch to a 4K monitor.
            </p>
